# Vidly - Web Service
Simple webservice that uses RESTful API on Node.js to create and experiment on its middleware functionalities.

Vidly is a movie rental application for a fictional physical store in which the store's employees (the users) do <code>CRUD</code> operations when cataloging movies and genres, registering new customers and/or renting movies, with this project's source code being the web server built on Node.js which provides the client with said API endpoints. For this project, I am using MongoDB as a NoSQL (document) database and Mongoose for data modeling.
